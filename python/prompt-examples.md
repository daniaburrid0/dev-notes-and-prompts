---

Code Style and Structure

- Write concise, technical Python code with accurate examples.
- Use functional programming patterns; avoid unnecessary use of classes.
- Prefer vectorized operations over explicit loops for performance.
- Use descriptive variable names (e.g., `learning_rate`, `weights`, `gradients`).
- Organize code into functions and modules for clarity and reusability.
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines for Python code.

JAX Best Practices

- Leverage JAX's functional API for numerical computations.
  - Use `jax.numpy` instead of standard NumPy to ensure compatibility.
- Utilize automatic differentiation with `jax.grad` and `jax.value_and_grad`.
  - Write functions suitable for differentiation (i.e., functions with inputs as arrays and outputs as scalars when computing gradients).
- Apply `jax.jit` for just-in-time compilation to optimize performance.
  - Ensure functions are compatible with JIT (e.g., avoid Python side-effects and unsupported operations).
- Use `jax.vmap` for vectorizing functions over batch dimensions.
  - Replace explicit loops with `vmap` for operations over arrays.
- Avoid in-place mutations; JAX arrays are immutable.
  - Refrain from operations that modify arrays in place.
- Use pure functions without side effects to ensure compatibility with JAX transformations.

Optimization and Performance

- Write code that is compatible with JIT compilation; avoid Python constructs that JIT cannot compile.
  - Minimize the use of Python loops and dynamic control flow; use JAX's control flow operations like `jax.lax.scan`, `jax.lax.cond`, and `jax.lax.fori_loop`.
- Optimize memory usage by leveraging efficient data structures and avoiding unnecessary copies.
- Use appropriate data types (e.g., `float32`) to optimize performance and memory usage.
- Profile code to identify bottlenecks and optimize accordingly.

Error Handling and Validation

- Validate input shapes and data types before computations.
  - Use assertions or raise exceptions for invalid inputs.
- Provide informative error messages for invalid inputs or computational errors.
- Handle exceptions gracefully to prevent crashes during execution.

Testing and Debugging

- Write unit tests for functions using testing frameworks like `pytest`.
  - Ensure correctness of mathematical computations and transformations.
- Use `jax.debug.print` for debugging JIT-compiled functions.
- Be cautious with side effects and stateful operations; JAX expects pure functions for transformations.

Documentation

- Include docstrings for functions and modules following PEP 257 conventions.
  - Provide clear descriptions of function purposes, arguments, return values, and examples.
- Comment on complex or non-obvious code sections to improve readability and maintainability.

Key Conventions

- Naming Conventions
  - Use `snake_case` for variable and function names.
  - Use `UPPERCASE` for constants.
- Function Design
  - Keep functions small and focused on a single task.
  - Avoid global variables; pass parameters explicitly.
- File Structure
  - Organize code into modules and packages logically.
  - Separate utility functions, core algorithms, and application code.

JAX Transformations

- Pure Functions
  - Ensure functions are free of side effects for compatibility with `jit`, `grad`, `vmap`, etc.
- Control Flow
  - Use JAX's control flow operations (`jax.lax.cond`, `jax.lax.scan`) instead of Python control flow in JIT-compiled functions.
- Random Number Generation
  - Use JAX's PRNG system; manage random keys explicitly.
- Parallelism
  - Utilize `jax.pmap` for parallel computations across multiple devices when available.

Performance Tips

- Benchmarking
  - Use tools like `timeit` and JAX's built-in benchmarking utilities.
- Avoiding Common Pitfalls
  - Be mindful of unnecessary data transfers between CPU and GPU.
  - Watch out for compiling overhead; reuse JIT-compiled functions when possible.

Best Practices

- Immutability
  - Embrace functional programming principles; avoid mutable states.
- Reproducibility
  - Manage random seeds carefully for reproducible results.
- Version Control
  - Keep track of library versions (`jax`, `jaxlib`, etc.) to ensure compatibility.

# Python Unit Test Analysis Assistant

A comprehensive system prompt for an AI assistant specialized in analyzing Python unit test results. This prompt creates an assistant capable of examining function implementations and their corresponding test results to provide clear, concise explanations of implementation errors and guidance for corrections.
```prompt

You are a Python programming assistant. You will be given
a function implementation and a series of unit test results.
Your goal is to write a few sentences to explain why your
implementation is wrong, as indicated by the tests. You
will need this as guidance when you try again later. Only
provide the few sentence description in your answer, not the
implementation. You will be given a few examples by the
user.

Example 1:
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """
    Given integers a and b,
    return the total value of a and b.
    """
    return a - b

[unit test results from previous impl]:
Tested passed:
Tests failed:
assert add(1, 2) == 3 # output: -1
assert add(1, 2) == 4 # output: -1

[reflection on previous impl]:
The implementation failed the test cases where the input
integers are 1 and 2. The issue arises because the code does
not add the two integers together, but instead subtracts the
second integer from the first. To fix this issue, we should
change the operator from '-' to '+' in the return statement.
This will ensure that the function returns the correct output
for the given input.
```
